   * Challenge: add the /host/vans and /host/vans/:id routes, as well
   * as the "Vans" link in the Host navbar.
   * 
   * For now, just create the stubbed-out version of the pages (i.e.
   * components that just render an <h1>). Don't worry about adding
   * navigation from /host/vans to /host/vans/:id yet - the link to
   * /host/vans is enough for now.
   * 
   * When deciding whether or not to use nested routes, keep in mind
   * what will/won't be shared between these two pages. See the Figma
   * design file (or the screenshots) to help guide your choice.
